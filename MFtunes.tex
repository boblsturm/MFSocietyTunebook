\item ``I feel strongly about this. Truth be told, I think building a machine that can compose billions of tunes is genuinely worthwhile. The thing is. This music isn't being made by a machine. It is being made by people, and the computer is a new instrument. And all that the AI is doing is using human creation. Humans made music first. Humans explore sound and intervals and humans are the ones that create these complex structures. It is entirely human-made music that is where this AI music is coming from. The AI couldn't make music without that human creation. All it is doing is uncovering patterns that humans have made, but might not have noticed. The AI is a tool of discovery; not a tool of usurping human creativity. It is highlighting what human creativity has done in the music the AI uses to learn. And more music can not be a bad thing, automated or not. Music can be both about the act of making and the act of listening. And if the experience is pleasant, it shouldn't matter if beforehand I'm told whether it was made by a human or an algorithm that used human creations to rework musical patterns that humans made. The music would have been the same, whichever the case. And I think I would love, deeply, the ability to continually be delighted by new songs. But most importantly, this music is made by humans, in a very meaningful way. The only difference is that this way of making music is able to surprise us. I think this has immense, immeasurable value.''  \href{https://youtu.be/KSoSyoEx6hc}{{\em Tristan Frodelius

\chapter{Introduction}
This growing curated collection contains tunes
arising from creative partnerships with {\em music Ai}. %\footnote{``Ai'' is an acronym for ``artificial intelligence''. 
%We do not capitalize the ``i'' because the ``intelligence'' is questionable.} 
Some Ai are trained on over 23,000 music transcriptions 
contributed by users of \href{http://thesession.org}{\tt thesession.org},
which is focused on Irish traditional dance music.
These are named {\em folk-rnn} v1, v2 and v3. 
The different versions arise from
different formats of the training material:
v1 models character sequences in a single document, 
including tune titles;
v2 models tokenized transcriptions that have been transposed to 
have a root of C;
v3 uses a slightly different data representation from v2.
Another Ai, {\em folk-rnn} (v. Swedish), was tuned using 4,000 transcriptions of 
Scandinavian folk music, collected from \href{http://folkwiki.se}{\tt folkwiki.se}.
Other variants of these systems have also been produced,
e.g., using different sampling techniques.

Each transcription herein revealed itself to the world 
through a computational procedure involving on average one billion operations.
They are not purely products of a cold and lifeless statistical algorithm 
attempting to imitate patterns it has learned from existing data ---
some human operator is needed to ``flip the switch'',
and then to curate from the materials generated.
Often the Ai generates poor results. 
Sometimes they are clearly derivative.
In a few cases, they can be unusual and wonderful.
The challenge is to find these ``diamonds'' in the raw materials.
%How easy is it to find these gems that are worth the time learning?
Then to bring them to life without ever heard them
played before by a master musician.
%How easily can a transcription be interpreted using 
%the ``templates'' of, say, Irish traditional music?
Even so, there remains the problem
of a tune existing without any trace whatsoever 
in a collective memory of a community of practitioners.
Their context is digital vapor.

Some believe in a purity or divinity of Art, and the superiority of humans in making Art. 
Involving a machine in Art can be seen as a direct challenge to this purity, 
not to mention a demotion of the human to machine. 
This argument elevates the tangible product over the intangible experience, 
and submits to a rather narrow and mystical notion of creating Art ---
a human activity, full stop. It is an activity that occurs between our ears in our sensations, thoughts and memories. Art is not contained on the page or in the frame. It does not stop when we leave the concert hall or the museum. Art is entirely steeped in being human. The human decision to involve technology in that activity is only that: the suspension of pigment in egg yolk to make it stick to a surface; the suspension of pigment in slow-drying oil to make it blend and layer in ways superior to egg tempura; the suspension of pigment in plastic medium to make it sculptable and fast drying; the use of a coarse horse hair brush to paint several strands of hair at once; the use of a palette knife to make sharp straight edges; the use of the principles of geometry and perspective to create trompe-l'œil. How is involving Ai in creating music any different? 
Computers have been able to beat the best human chess players for decades, 
but for some reason people are still playing and studying chess. Why?

One pitfall important to avoid when it comes to discussing Ai in the Arts is this: 
thinking that the terms “intelligence” and “learning” mean what they commonly mean when it comes to people. These are “suitcase” words with several meanings that can be confused, and must be unpacked. In the context of Ai, “intelligence” is a quite brittle thing that bears very little resemblance to human intelligence. And “learning” is merely the prosaic computation of numbers in an algorithm that represent probabilistic relationships in data. Falling into this trap can give power to the Ai that it does not actually possess,
leading to dystopian fantasies.
To claim Ai will destroy music is the same as claiming, e.g., photography will destroy painting, perspective drawing will destroy narrative, and so on. Yes, the future is filled with composers and painters, photographers and writers … The only real threats to the Arts are the lack of value for it in a society, and proscriptions of practice due to pressures economic, political, religious, etc.


% Maybe someone has said, \href{https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50573071}{“Why should I continue playing if I can never beat the computer?”} I would then wonder why they put so much weight on winning that it precludes them from playing? I bring up chess playing because when I compose or learn a tune, I think of it as an enjoyable intellectual challenge, much like playing chess. The experience is the most important part for me, not necessarily the end result.

\section{Frequently Asked Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``What is {\em machine folk}?''\\
Music that springs from human and machine (Ai) partnership,
played on traditional instruments as if such a thing has been done for centuries.
Other terms for this kind of music are: {\em faux folk} and {\em trAiditional music}. 
%\item ``How is {\em machine folk} different from {\em fake folk}?\\
%{\em Machine folk} becomes {\em fake folk} with fabricated folklore. (See present volume.)
\item ``Why {\em machine folk}?''\\
Why not?
\item ``I mean, why not play {\em real} traditional music?''\\
Let's! But currently only a few people in the entire world 
are playing folk music generated by machines,
which makes it dangerously close to becoming extinct. 
\item ``Do we really need to involve Ai in music?''\\ 
No, in the same way that we don't really need to involve pianos. 
\item ``Why do you have a lower-case `i' when you write `Ai'''?\\
To highlight the fact that its ``intelligence'' is questionable.
\item ``Isn't music robotic enough these days?'' \\
%Depends what is meant by ``music''. 
%``Robotic'' is an aim for some styles, e.g., sequenced, electronic dance music.
%For {\em machine folk}, ``robotic'' need not be the aim,
%or an unavoidable outcome.
What's wrong with ``robotic''?
\item ``I mean, isn't music supposed to come from the soul? Isn't it an expression of our humanity? Aren't the sentiments expressed supposed to touch us and make us empathize with the composer?'' \\
Who says those things? Also see in the present volume 
the \hyperlink{piece:WhyAreYou}{``love song''} to an algorithm, 
and the tunes ``celebrating'' a particular dog.
%Music has been, is, and continues to be far broader than simply expressing sentiments.
%Many of us have sentiments for machines. 
%Besides, it seems somewhat normal to care for an algorithm that
%one has built and watched grow.
%Playing {\em machine folk} is not an exclusionary practice.
%Plus there is something in {\em machine folk} that speaks of 
%a people awash in computer technology, data harvesting, surveillance, automation ...
%{\em Machine folk} is in a real sense an expression of our humanity vis-\`a-vis the machine.
\item ``Have you lost your soul?'' \\
Not that we are aware of; or, maybe yes?
Let's ask the machine to generate a tune about it.
\item ``Can we not technologically tamper with everything that is good and pure in this world?'' \\
Technological tampering is how musical instruments are created.
%We are definitely partial to the romantic idea of returning to the way things were 
%before fire was discovered and all hell broke loose.
%But then we realize that most  wouldn't exist.
\item ``Are you working to replace human composers and musicians?'' \\
No. Humans are an essential part of {\em machine folk},
from the programming and training of the Ai, 
to the curation of the generated music and its performance in the real world
on real instruments.
\item ``Won't this technology lead to replacing human composers and musicians?'' \\
If something can be automated, it will be automated.
Regardless if an Ai can compose music,
humans will continue to compose.
%Suffering is an essential part of the human condition.
\item ``Who owns these tunes?'' \\
The meaningfulness of this question is not clear in a society that has decided it's acceptable to not pay for music.\footnote{Compliments to \href{https://www.thefader.com/2020/02/25/holly-herndon-ai-generated-travis-scott-song-travisbott-jack-park-canny-dope-man-interview}{Holly Herndon}.}
Regardless, traditional music sits uncomfortably with such notions because it is much more like a public park for all to enjoy than private property for one to rent. The output of folk-rnn might be considered more like the public park – perhaps a little derelict with some broken glass and rusty nails laying around. No place for a picnic really; but still, many of its nooks and crannies are wonderful to visit and explore.
\item ``How will this help traditional music?''\\
Does traditional music need help?
%We are more concerned with how this could harm traditional music.
\item ``OK. How will this harm traditional music?''\\
Likely not one bit. These machines are just parlour tricks.
But it is important to keep watch for unintended consequences.
%\item ``By what criteria does The Society select tunes for this tunebook?''\\
%The criteria have yet to be formally defined,
%but certainly among them are things like musical sense, quirkiness, playability, and humor.
\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Tunes of the Society}
This chapter presents the tunes of the Society
categorized by rhythm.
When a tune involves some modification from 
the transcription produced by the machine, the original
is rendered as small notation.

When Society Member Näsström shared the photo at left with the Society,
Member Sturm decided to ask folk-rnn (v2) to compose a jig about it.
The output, seen in small notation, was then modified a bit by Sturm to create the jig.
More information about this particular transcription is \href{https://themachinefolksession.org/tune/902}{here.}
One of Sturm's Irish accordion teachers says this tune sounds like the kind of new jigs
created by contemporary Irish composers, e.g., 
Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin.

This tune was learned from folk-rnn (v2),
which generated it under a particular sampling regimen.
More information \href{https://highnoongmt.wordpress.com/2019/08/19/making-sense-of-the-folk-rnn-v2-model-part-11/}{here}.
The title was generated by folk-rnn (v1) for a different tune, 
but applied to this tune because Society Member Sturm thinks it fits.
%\href{https://youtu.be/V8eYj7y2xn4}{Listen to Henrik Norbeck's interpretation of the tune.}
There's a claim that the turn (B-part) resembles that of a traditional Irish tune named, ``The Thatched Cabin''.
That particular tune does not appear in the training data of this folk-rnn model.
One of Sturm's Irish accordion teachers says this tune sounds like an old jig, 
and is ready to be learned as is.

The title was generated by folk-rnn (v1) for a different tune,

Only one slight change is made to the last measure.
One of Sturm's Irish accordion teachers says
this sounds like a classic jig.

while browsing the \href{http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sturm/research/RNNIrishTrad/Session/}{Endless MF Session website}
(\href{http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sturm/research/RNNIrishTrad/Session/5583_11843.mp3}{synthesized recording}).
The title was generated by folk-rnn (v1) for a different tune,

One of Sturm's Irish accordion teachers pointed out that
the first part of the tune closely resembles the jig ``Old Man Dillon'',
but the second part is completely unique and wonderful.
Society Member Sturm thus modified the first part.

The jig was generated by folk-rnn (v2), sampled with beamsearch (n=2),
and selected by an artificial critic comparing the outputs
with O'Neill's 365 double jigs in the ``1001'' collection.
In the 10001 jigs generated by the system and selected by the critic,
it appears as \#8091.

by a fellow whose screen name is ``Namloc". 
It appears in that volume as \#39. 
He \href{https://thesession.org/discussions/39604}{says}, ``Tune 39 was actually sounding 
like quite a plausible traditional tune up until it ended on a low E 
when it clearly should have ended on a G instead''. 
Society member Sturm has named the tune after the helpful fellow, 
but has kept the E for drama and contrast.

Society member Sturm got this hornpipe from folk-rnn (v2) 
when he asked it for a tune about the spider living in his bathroom – whom he named “Ms. Riddles”.
For one wonderful week, the silverfish in his bathroom disappeared thanks to Ms. Riddles. To show his gratitude, he caught and froze a fly, and gave it to Ms. Riddles. She seemed to enjoy eating it, and used it to decorate her porch, along with what appears to be the King of the Silverfish.
Ms. Riddles is long gone now, but her memory lives on in this wonderful hornpipe.

One of Sturm's Irish accordion teachers says this tune is more like a strathspey or highland

They wanted to write a polka for their two friends Göran and Pelle, 
with whom they play and enjoy Irish music. 
Göran couldn't make a session because he was sick, 
and Pelle had to cancel because he had cut his finger.
The system was seeded with {\tt |:c/2d/2e dc | BG B2} to create first part,
and then 
{\tt |:c/2d/2edc |BGB2 |c/2d/2e/2d/2cd |ed/2c/2BG | cd/2e/2dc |BGBB |c2B/2c/2d |c2c2 :| |:c'b gc' | bg}

the viola saw the opportunity!''
Sturm replied, ``Oh, then we will call it `Viola on a chair.'''
Näsström replied, ``I think a viola is a fiddle too, just a bigger one.''
Sturm finally named the tune, ``Biggish Fiddle on a Smallish Chair.''
